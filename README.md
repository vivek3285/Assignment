Here is  given a list wich contains two shorter words in the given array.

Input: words =  ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]

here those  who are the two concatenating shorter words are printed

Output: ["catsdogcats","ratcatdogcat"]

Here hippopotamuses longest word but it does not contain two shorter hence 

Explanation:- 
catsdogcats:-can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats" 

ratcatdogcat:- can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".

Note:hippopotamuses do not contain two shorter words therefore I did not print.

 where n = len, p = avg of the word 

public IList  :- it is a collection of objects that are used to access each element individually with the help of an index.
